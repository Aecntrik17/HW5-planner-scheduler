# HW5-planner-scheduler

Homework #5, java and jquery create a day planner including moment.js

This project directive was to create a day planner schedule so that a busy person could utilize it and also have a visual affect of when things are happening.

The planner should display the current date on the page, regardless of which day the user opens the planner. User can view and select time blocks for the day, which are to be color coded representing its position of past, present, or future with actual time.

User can input data into the time block and save. Once the save element is initiated, the date is stored not only to the page but local storage so that even if the page is reloaded the agenda for that time block remains displayed.

I added a clear button, which allows the user to remove displayed data from the page, but not local storage.

I also added a reset button, which allows the user to empty the local storage and clear the display as well.
